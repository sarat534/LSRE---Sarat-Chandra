**A Case Study Evaluation of the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements:**

The article depicts decision making during the release planning for the market driven software products to maximize the benefits. Also, achieving targeted quality requirements to with stand the demands and sustain the competition are the challenging problems in release planning. Existing literature provides only two release planning methods that address quality constraints. One is the quantitative Win-Win model that addresses effort and time constraints. But it did not address the quality level of Quality requirements (QR). And another method that addresses quality and cost constraints of QR is the QUPER model. So, the author follow ups the QUPER model to support decision making in release planning of quality requirements. This decision making process is essential in marketing software products to sustain the competition and quality when compared to the opponent product. The two motivational factors that are responsible for the evolution of QUPER model are:  a need for a model is identified in industry and also a suitable model that supports the release planning of QR was not found in the literature. The cost dependency steps given in the QUPER model are: 
	The study investigates the practitioner’s perspective on utilities of QUPER. Richard et al. performs a case study and also provides a set of guidelines to apply QUPER model in practice. The author also insights handling both the cost dependencies and quality requirements. The major contribution of the article could be the guidelines that are in accordance with real practice. The article proposes transferability of guidelines and examples to support the adopted methodology as a future research.  
	
**Introducing Support for Release Planning of Quality Requirements — An Industrial Evaluation of the QUPER Model**

The article mainly deals with the market driven development and release planning. Release planning involves applying decision-making that combine marketing with implementation concerns. It involves aspects such as selecting of features and requirements, deciding on releasing time and cost. So, in order to support release planning and considering quality requirements the authors developed the quality performance (QUPER) model. Balancing of quality requirements plays an important role to attain success, considering these two aspects. To achieve this a conceptual model that has quality as a dimension for prioritizing quality requirements has been developed. The paper presents an industrial evaluation of the QUPER model by implementing and evaluating at Sony Ericsson, to check its implementation in industry. Another objective of the implementation is to evaluate the industrial introduction of the model. QUPER model has mainly three steps: problem definition, model definition and model validation. Considering project priority, the scope is adjusted to make sure that the features that involved in the project are having highest return of investment. Then the high-level features are refined into requirements. The refinement includes both functional and quality requirements. After refined, cost estimations are redone. If there are any changes in the market, that are impacting either market value estimations or selected features, then marketed value estimations are also redone. 

	Some of the challenges identified while implementing this model are acceptance of quality levels, specification of performance requirements, and specifying quantifiable performance requirements and respective conditions that should be fulfilled. The presented concepts like breakpoints, competitor analysis, and identification of quality level in a particular release can provide an understanding of different market segment the need for quality level. The final results shows that the model gives helpful information in decision making process, regarding the quality requirements in release planning. The aim of the model is combine QUPER with current prevailing practices. Also, the results shows more accuracy for difficult estimations when using this quality performance model.

Reflections:

In this seminar the discussion is carried out in how the requirements are dealt. In this seminar the main concept is about the release planning. This is performed as a joint activity over the entire duration of the course. Issues are created in an online repository for tracking the issues. This is done using Github. In the release planning the requirements are prioritized by using grouping technique, with MoSCow method. The articles The art and science of release planning, A case study evaluation of the guideline-supported QUPER model for elicitation of quality requirements, Introducing support for release planning of quality requirements –an industrial evaluation of the QUPER and A market-driven requirements engineering process:
results from an industrial process improvement programme are summarized and are helpful in answering the questions and gave us a brief idea related to the seminar. 


**Seminar 1 Questions:**

GAP Analysis: GAP analysis is a method which is used to measure the customer value. It measures the positive and negative gaps between the product and the customer view. GAP analysis helps in finding the characteristics and features of the product and customer satisfaction is summarized. In gap analysis the current state, desired state and the plan to fill the gaps will be listed. The positive gap represents in a good and satisfied product for the customer and the negative gap represents the opposite [2].

CVA Analysis: CVA acronym Customer Value Analysis. CVA analysis is same as GAP analysis. But in CVA the competitor product point view is also involved. By comparing our product and the competitor product we can find what changes need to be applied our product. In CVA the customer value for our product and the competitor product is identified. By using this the market value can be estimated. Both GAP and CVA are used in measuring the selection quality post-release [2].

IVA Analysis: IVA acronym Internet Value Analysis. It is a method in which an analysis is done to make sure that the product is maintaining the company strategies, resources and considering other products. The analysis is done with respective to money, time and risk factor. By performing this the product market and value can be observed [2].

Technical Product management:

Technical product management is a typical task which is handled by a technical product manager. The term technical product manager depicts a product manager with a technical background. Product manager has several important tasks, such as management of requirements, release planning and launching of products. He should be interactive with the development team and by having some technical knowledge he can discuss the development status. The manager should be capable in understanding the development status of a product and the development work should be monitored.

Roadmapping:

Roadmapping is a process in which the list of release plan and the time and date of the release plan [1]. The list is prepared in a documentation format. The requirements are identified by knowing the future development, in a roadmap on the basis of the current market situation. The roadmapping process consists of four phases [1], they are 

Initiation Phase – A team is formed for roafmapping.
Preparation Phase – Consists of themes and a schedule for creating a roadmap.
Finalization Phase – Validation of the roadmap.
Follow up Phase – Changes are made based on the feedback.

In large scale there are many aspects to be considered before creating the roadmap, some of them are

i. Business strategies and Processes

ii. Determine and meet requirements

iii. Define the scope

iv. Market analysis

v. Product or service analysis

vi. Technology analysis

**The characteristics of the product can be determined by Quality Requirements (QR) like usability and performance: **

In this articles, the authors have performed an extended interview study. The interview was conducted on 22practitioners from 11 different companies of which six are multinational companies. The results of this study emphasis on elicitation, analysis, and management of quality requirements in the industry. The authors have chosen interviews over doing a large survey as the concept of quality requirements is treated and named in different types in various companies. From data collected through interviews, the authors try to analysis and compare how quality requirements are handled in companies working in business-to-business (B2B) markets and companies that are working in business-to-consumers (B2C) markets. The main important requirements in B2B is usability and in B2C is safety. Next the authors compare and examine the interdependencies among the quality requirements is the functionality depends on one requirement. But it is not vice versa. There is a variation observed between B2B and B2C companies. If a CVALUE of a requirement changes then there is a change for another requirement value. The authors also try to characterize the selection and management of quality requirements in various activities. In the results it showed that the B2C results are more accurate when compare with the B2B industries. In this study it clears shows that 41% of the QR are eliminated in the B2B companies and 31% of the QR are eliminated in the B2C companies. Consequences are faced in the project as the QRs are not considered there may occur many problems in the development of the product. Though the product can be delivered before the time, but the product couldn’t work efficiently. The results of this research stated that all QR are not quantifiable.


**A Cost–Value Approach for Prioritizing Requirements:**

The paper presents a description about deciding on requirements. And says that the task is a difficult task and one has more demand because of its time and budget constraints. After deciding the requirements, they act as a focal point for development process and produce software system that meets the needs and expectations of customers and users. The study insights the selecting subset of the customers’ requirements to meets their needs. To verify this the author proposed a cost–value approach for prioritizing requirements and performed a case study by applied it to two commercial projects namely RAN (Radio access network project) and PMR (Performance Management Traffic Recording project) projects. RAN project identifies and specifies the requirements and information regarding the mobile system operations. Most software organizations uses this selection process informally, and frequently to produce software systems that can be used by the developers, customers, and users. A clear knowledge about the requirement priorities can helps in increasing the efficiency of the development process. During the product release, knowing how to prioritize the requirements is essential and can help in planning releases. To verify and support this statement, the authors developed an analytical tool to rank and prioritize the requirements based on the cost value approach. The tool can rank the requirements in two dimensions, one is their estimated cost of implementation and another one is relative value. The method is applied successfully in two commercial telecommunications software projects. Depending on this information, the managers decide on the requirements that should be included to reduce the time to market. To investigate the requirements, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to compare the requirements pairwise according to their relative value and cost. The cost value tool can store the information about pair wise comparisons such as people responsible, their rationale and their assumptions.


Reflections:


RAM model is a very important model in which the requirements can be differentiated into different levels. This is helpful for large scale requirements for keep on tracking the requirements and the requirements can be easily prioritized. This is a good model for abstracting the requirements. This model implementation results positive outputs in the industry.


A method for early requirements triage and selection utilizing product strategies is useful for an industry as a technical product managers can discuss on the development of requirements. This article is helpful in answering a question.


Requirements engineering in search of dependent variables explains the importance and level of impact on the quality levels. In this article it is clearly shown that how the requirements effects the product, company, project and society. So care must be taken while choosing the requirements.


Quality Requirements in Industrial Practice – an extended interview study at elven companies. In this article the importance of the quality requirements in making a project success is discussed. As said by the authors now-a-days quality requirements are mainly not considered in some companies. So, problems are faced during the development and after the product is developed.


A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements. In this the cost to value approach is considered. It is a typical task in performing this method to a large sale without any sufficient tools for the calculations.


**Seminar 2 Questions **


1.Boston Matrix:

Boston matrix is a tool which is used for managing, analyzing the product and product portfolio. Boston matrix helps in comparing the growth and share of a product in the market.  Boston matrix consists of market growth on the Y-axis and relative market share on X-axis. In some situations the market has high growth but less share and the situation changes into opposite. This matrix helps in companies to make valuable decisions in the situations. Boston matrix describes the X-axis and Y-axis influence on market share by four categories. They are dogs, cash cows, question marks or problem children and stars.

Dogs: The problems faced in this area are of low market share and low market growth.

Cash Cows: These have a high market share in low growing market.

Question marks or Problem Children: In this there is a sudden growth and the resources utilization is high. These have a low market share.

Stars: In this the market share is high with an increase in the market growth.

2 . The architecture helps in finding a brief view of to the development team. The architecture is designed by fixing a particular goal. In this the goals will be the requirements taken. The requirements might be functional or non-functional. The architecture design can be performed in several methods. The method of designing an architecture is done based on the requirements and also on the architecture.

3 . Most of the requirements will not be directly connected to the architecture. Some of the requirements which are chosen will not be at the level of the architecture. Such type of requirements are eliminated. For designing an architecture the requirements which are equal to the architecture design level would be considered for the design.

**Towards a Reference Framework for Software Product Management:**

The author presents a study regarding software product management (SPM) from practical viewpoint. It present a reference framework for software product management, by identifying the key process areas like portfolio management, product road mapping, release planning and requirements management, besides considering the stakeholders and their relations. In release planning, managing requirements, defining releases, and defining products by involving stakeholders is done by the product manager. The structure of the reference framework depends upon the artifacts of product management, identified set of stakeholders by the product manager. The framework has the portfolio management on the top with four processes like partnering & contracting, market trend identification, product lifecycle management and product line identification. Using this reference framework, the author presents a body of knowledge for SPM. As a future work the paper proposes the steps that are to be taken in order to successfully introduce product management in a product software company.


Reflections:

Towards a reference framework for software product management. This articles is mainly useful to explicit the key concepts in a product management. This model is a first step which helps the product to be maintained in the market.

MDRE for software products have many challenges and challenges should be taken care. In MDRE process the flow of requirements is high. The handling of requirements should be done in a careful way.

Are you biting off more than you can chew? A case study on causes and effects of over scoping in large-scale software engineering. In this article the factors and effects of over scoping are described. These would helpful for the industry in creating a checklist so that the cause will not repeat in their industry.

Exploring factors affecting decision outcome and lead time large scale requirements engineering. In this paper the case study is conducted on large scale and survey is performed on small scale. Decision making will differ in large scale and small scale industries.

An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning. Before planning a release all the interdependencies of the requirements should be planned to reduce the complexity while prioritizing the requirements. There are many circumstances that may face if the interdependencies are not considered, like the requirements may change and the requirement will be high complex to develop and cannot release in the present release. To reduce this type of issues the interdependencies should be considered. It is very important to find the interdependencies before prioritizing so the complexity of the problem can be reduced, and release can be done in a smooth way. So, the reason for selecting this article is to know the importance of interdependencies of requirements and how they are helpful in a release planning.

**Chalmers: Assessing challenges of continuous integration in the context of software requirements breakdown: a case study**

The paper presents a brief description of Continuous integration (CI) that deals with the frequency at which changes takes place. It emphasizes multiple code check-ins on a daily basis and it is the next stage in the development of an agile research and the agile practices. CI increases the frequency of software releases and reduces the feedback cycle. In addition, it reduces the time that developers take to check the code in maintaining product quality. Most of the companies have a fixed time during a sprint where integration takes place. To support more frequent integration, small requirements are needed for the developers to test them separately and then integrate them frequently. The paper presents a case study at Ericsson, that explores the challenges of continuous integration and requirements break down. Also, it explains how the requirements breakdown affects the implementation of a continuous integration process. For this process, the author conducts semi-structured interviews with 13 subjects from both Sweden and China. The study mainly identifies the challenges in implementing CI in practice, identifying challenges in breaking down the software requirements, and identifying the influence of breakdown of requirements in adopting continuous integration. The results indicate Mindset, tools and infrastructure, testing, domain applicability, understanding, code dependencies and software requirements as challenges in implementing CI in practice. The author uses a thematic diagram to represent them. Also, the results illustrate, requirements abstraction, alignment of requirements and tests, customer value, and guiding principles as challenges in breaking down the requirements. And finally the influence of software requirements breakdown’s influence on continues integration depends on necessity of breakdown and implication of breakdown. A further classification of the above mentioned factors into six sub factors namely big impact requirements, maintenance versus features development, implementation dependencies, integration scope, test dependencies, on demand software delivery is done. Thus as a contribution, the paper presents the challenges that companies face when adopting CI and breaking down software requirements. The study involves only one company and extending the study to other companies is proposed as a future work.

Reflections:

Assessing challenges of continuous integration in the context of software requirements breakdown: a case study. In this article the authors have identified some challenges in using continuous integration. Continuous integration is used in delivering a product to the customer on time. The challenges identified are limited to one company only. Future work should be performed to identify the generalized challenges while implementing the Continuous integration.
