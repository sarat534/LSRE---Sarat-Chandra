**Week 52**
Work done for Release planning:
The requirements are prioritized in this week. For the release planning a meeting is conducted. In this meeting the prioritization technique is discussed. I have proposed some prioritization techniques. After the discussion as a team we have decided to use a grouping technique in which MoSCoW method is used for prioritizing the requirements. In this method the requirements are divided into four categories, they are Must have, Should have, Could have and Wont have. The customer value is considered as the main criteria for prioritizing the requirements into the categories which are mentioned in the above. The release plan is also based on the Art and Science of release planning, i.e. in assigning the milestones for the requirements. The prioritization is based on the future implementation of a requirement. For clarifying this let us assume an example to have a password feature first there must be the number characters required for the password. In this example first the number of characters required for the password is prioritized and then the password will be prioritized.

Each member self-assigned the issues. Some issues may be assigned randomly and some are of on the particular requirement. The issues are assigned based upon the individual interest. The labels are also classified and the each requirements are assigned to a particular milestones. This process of assigning milestones to the requirements is done by the member who self-assigned for the issue.

The issues which are assigned by me are 11 in total and each issue is assigned to a particular milestone. Each milestone is having a goal. These two can be viewed in the below links.

The issues are assigned to milestone by categorizing them into Must have, Should have, Could have, Wont have. The roadmapping for the product is done in this way. The issues which are assigned by me are in the milestones 0.1, 0.5, 0.8 and 0.9. The issues mainly I assigned are related to login feature. By using GitHub, the issues can be easily assigned to a particular based upon the interest. The labels are available to classify the issues and issues are assigned to milestones so that the release plan can be done easily. It is also helpful in creating some new issues.


The release planning is done in a process by reading the article “The art and science of software release planning” [1]. From this article we got to know that if each milestone is set with a goal then the requirements can be easily distributed. The roadmapping of the requirements is done based on the article “Market-driven requirements engineering for software products” [2]. The requirements are prioritized by following a technique which is read in the article “Requirements prioritization” [3] by selecting MoSCoW method in the grouping technique. As grouping technique would be better for prioritizing the requirements, we should also consider the dependencies between the requirements. The dependencies between the requirements is solved by referring an article “An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning” [4].


By performing this assignment I understand that each release plan consists of requirements prioritization and during prioritizing the requirements the dependencies should be considered. A technique should be used to prioritize the requirements for release plan. Setting a milestone and there should be a goal for each milestone. As I am one of the participant in the assignment my feeling is that the release planning can be done more effectively if all the participants have participated very actively in the performing it like a real product release planning rather than like an assignment.
