  1.	What is large scale requirements engineering?
  2.	What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?
  3.	What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are
      discussing?

Answers:
  1.	Gathering requirements for developing a software system from large scale organizations is called as large scale requirements          engineering.
  2.  The main challenges observed in large scale requirements engineering are gathering the requirements, prioritizing the                 requirements, analyzing the requirements, satisfying the customer value. The requirements are gathered base on the need of            stakeholders.The requirements are to be prioritized so that which requirements can be done first. The prioritization of the           requirements is done based on the importance of the requirement.

  The Art and Science of Software Release Planning
  This article is about the art and science of a release planning. The art of release planning approach relays on communication and     human intuition, whereas the science of release planning approach applies algorithms to specify the problem and to obtain better      solutions for the problem. In this article, the combination of both art and science is proposed to define optimal release planning.
  Release planning is an important event for a developed product. An assumption is made to characterize a good release plan based on    some criteria.
  •	Providing maximum business value by offering the best possible blend of features in the right sequence of releases.
  •	Satisfying most important stakeholders who are involved.
  •	Feasible in terms of the existing resource capacities available.
  •	Reflecting existing dependencies between features.
  The difficulties which are faced in an organization is to provide a good release plan. These difficulties are based on the            complexity of the problems. These complexities are to be described in a formal way to determine a good release plan. Release          planning is based on ad hoc not on the methodologies used for the development. According to CMMI the main motive of a project         release plan is to involve the stakeholders, commitments towards the plan and maintaining the plan. In this paper the author          represented two approaches for release planning. The first one is ‘art of release planning’ which mainly considers the human          intuition   and communication. And the second one is ‘the science of release planning’ which relays on the methodology and accurate   data. For art of release planning small releases help in providing a fast feedback from the customer which is a key principle of      extreme programming. For science of release planning all the data should be formalized. As most of this is carried in ad hoc some     researchers formulated some models. Some features have dependencies between them so they can be coupled and released in a single      release. The features are prioritize based on the importance of the features. As both the approaches are having their own             explanation they are complementary.
  
  A Case Study Evaluationof the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements
	In this article a model it is described that a model is developed to support high-level decision-making during release planning of quality requirement. The model is QUPER model. The challenges which are faced by the organizations during the development of a software to the market are also discussed.
